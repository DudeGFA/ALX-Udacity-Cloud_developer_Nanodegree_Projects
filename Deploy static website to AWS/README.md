# Deploy a static website through Amazon web services

### Steps taken:

* First, I created an S3 bucket

* I uploaded the website files to the bucket

* I secured it using IAM policies

* The bucket was then configured for website hosting

* I sped up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

### The website can be accessed using a web browser through 3 methods:
1. **Through it's CloudFront domain name**

2. **Access the website via website-endpoint**

3. **Access the bucket object via its S3 object URL**

>Due to the cost of using AWS services and the limited budget allocated to the AWS account provided by Udacity, the website is currently unavaliable.
